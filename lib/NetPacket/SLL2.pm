=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use NetPacket::SLL2;

  my $sll_obj = NetPacket::SLL2->decode($raw_pkt);
  my $sll_pkt = $sll_obj->encode();
  my $sll_data = NetPacket::SLL2::strip($raw_pkt);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<NetPacket::SLL2> provides a set of routines for assembling and
disassembling packets using Linux cooked capture (libpcap SLL2).
Linux cooked capture is a pseudo-link-layer used by libpcap when
capturing packets on the "any" device (because packets may have
different link layer headers) or when the native link layer headers
can't be used.

See L<https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/wikis/SLL> and
L<https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes/LINKTYPE_LINUX_SLL2.html> for
more details on the SLL2 protocol.

=head2 Methods

=over

=item C<NetPacket::SLL2-E<gt>decode([RAW PACKET])>

Decode the raw packet data given and return an object containing
instance data.  This method will quite happily decode garbage input.
It is the responsibility of the programmer to ensure valid packet data
is passed to this method.

=item C<$sll_obj-E<gt>encode()>

Return an SLL2 packet encoded with the instance data specified.

=back

=head2 Functions

=over

=item C<NetPacket::SLL2::strip([RAW PACKET])>

Return the encapsulated data (or payload) contained in the SLL2
packet.  This data is suitable to be used as input for other
C<NetPacket::*> modules.

This function is equivalent to creating an object using the
C<decode()> constructor and returning the C<data> field of that
object.

=back

=head2 Instance data

The instance data for the C<NetPacket::SLL2> object consists of
the following fields.

=over

=item proto

The protocol type for the packet. Usually an ethernet protocol type,
but the meaning depends on the device type as described at
L<https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes/LINKTYPE_LINUX_SLL2.html>.

=item interface

The 1-based index of the interface this packet was observed on.

=item htype

The device type as a L<Linux ARP hardware
type|https://www.iana.org/assignments/arp-parameters/arp-parameters.xhtml>.

=item type

The SLL packet type.

  # SLL_TYPE_UNICAST
  0, if the packet was specifically sent to us by somebody else;
  # SLL_TYPE_BROADCAST
  1, if the packet was broadcast by somebody else;
  # SLL_TYPE_MULTICAST
  2, if the packet was multicast, but not broadcast, by somebody else;
  # SLL_TYPE_SENT_TO_OTHER
  3, if the packet was sent to somebody else by somebody else;
  # SLL_TYPE_SENT_BY_US
  4, if the packet was sent by us.

=item src_addr

Up to the first 8 bytes of the source link-layer address for this
packet as a hex string.

=item data

The encapsulated data (payload) for this SLL2 packet.

=back

=head2 Exports

=over

=item default

none

=item tags

The following tags group together related exportable items.

=over

=item C<:types>

Re-exported from L<NetPacket::SLL> for convenience.

=item C<:strip>

Import the strip function C<sll2_strip>.

=item C<:ALL>

All the above exportable items.

=back

=back

=head1 EXAMPLE

The following script prints the source address, device type, and
protocol type of each packet to standard output.

  #!/usr/bin/perl

  use strict;
  use warnings;
  use Net::PcapUtils;
  use NetPacket::SLL2;

  sub process_pkt {
      my ($user, $hdr, $pkt) = @_;
      my $sll_obj = NetPacket::SLL2->decode($pkt);
      print("$sll_obj->{src_addr} $sll_obj->{htype} $sll_obj->{proto}\n");
  }

  Net::PcapUtils::loop(\&process_pkt);
